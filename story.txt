	Ronald had just finished his final exam at UW-Madison and was on his way home to pack up his belongings and go home for the summer when ha mass of students came running at him from the opposite direction. He froze as the seemingly furious crowd came closer and closer. . As the students came into earshot what he heard would stay with him for the rest of his life.
	
	"there he is, the one who disabled the C4 explosive and saved countless people" came the cry from various people. Ronald was left flabbergasted,he had no idea about there being a bomb somewhere in the university, let alone disabling one himself. Before he could compose himself enough to ask anything, the crowd had reached him and had started asking questions , while many showered praises on him for his courage and wit.     

"Harold! Harold! How does it feel being the town hero!," shouted one of the hecklers.
"Harold?," thought Ronald. They've made a mistake. He's no hero! He just looks like one! Ronald thought about the coming out with the truth, but he wasn't too sure about it. He was starting to enjoy the fame. What Ronald did next surprised everybody.

Ronald found the nearest raised surface, which happened to be a picnic bench,
and shouted, "It is I, the hero! Bow down to your king!" People were in 
awe of his lack of humbleness that they were disgusted by him. They turned 
away from him and Ronald realized his mistake.
Ronald never wanted to be a hero, and he wasnt good at it. He went from the people's hero to a public enemy. Everyone hated Ronald now. His new task
was to mend all of the relationships he had broken.
